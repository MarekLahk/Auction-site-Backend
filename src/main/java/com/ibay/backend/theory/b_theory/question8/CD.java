    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Giving the customer/users a new version of your product

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Releasing your updated product frequently without large caps in delivery times and avoiding large updates

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [] test
    // [x] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 Time - updates are released regularly so the client doesnt have to wait as long to get their requests fulfilled or errors/bugs fixed

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // 1 Higher chance of bugs/mistakes getting into production because each small release doesnt usually get the same amount of testing as an update which is released for example every 6 months

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // CI/CD: CI
    // Because: CD is kind of reliant on CI - having a constant stream of small updates and a main branch that is constantly kept in working order allows CD practices.
