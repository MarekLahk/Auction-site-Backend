    //todo
    // One of the reasons we use Spring is that it gives us good support for
    // Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)

    //todo p1
    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is Dependency Injection?
    // Answer: Dependency injection is a way of automatically creating objects that
	//			are then passed to all the classes that need it.

    //todo p2
    // Bring example from your code of Dependency Injection.
    // Paste your code here, but comment it out
	
	//    @Autowired
    //public AuctionService(AuctionDao auctionDao, UserDao userDao, IdGenerator idGenerator) {
	//
    //    this.auctionDao = auctionDao;
    //    this.userDao = userDao;
    //    this.idGenerator = idGenerator;
    //}

    //todo p3
    // Name 2 benefits of Dependency Injection
    // 1 No multiple instances of classes are created
    // 2 Reduces boilerplate code

    //todo p4
    // Name 1 disadvantage of Dependency Injection
    // 1 Can be difficult to understand which dependecy is used in which situation
