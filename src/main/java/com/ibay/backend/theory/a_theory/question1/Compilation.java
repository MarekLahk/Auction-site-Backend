    // What is compilation?
    // Answer: Compilation is taking human-readable code and making it understandable
	// 			for a computer. This involves analyzing the entire code and making
	//			optimizations. This is done before running the code. Output of this
    //          process is machine code that is not human-readable

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of compilation?
    // 1 Programs run much faster
    // 2 Mistakes are likely to be caught by the compiler

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of compilation?
    // 1 Code cannot be altered at runtime
